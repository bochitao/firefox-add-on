Patch note Nov 22 3pm Bochi Tao
Added:
  - menu bar button: when clicked in a youtube video page, open a new page and
    play the video. Does nothing when clicked on other pages.
  - right-click menu buttons: two options "Play in youtube hover" and "Add to
    Youtube Hover playlist".Does nothing when clicked.

Comments:
  - The broswer window APIs in the addon sdk is very highlevel and allows no
    customization. The "chrome window" seems to be the lower level apis for
    modifying windows, however it cannot be called directly from addons. Needs
    to look into this.
  - Having the video playing window always on the top-level does not seem to be
    supported in firefox. Very tricky.
  - The right-click menu options seems only runs page scripts, kinda tricky here
    since arguments(url for now) need to be passed in and other functions needs
    to be called.
